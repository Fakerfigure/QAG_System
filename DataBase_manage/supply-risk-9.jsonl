{"标题": "geng-et-al-2023-supply-risk-mitigation-in-a-decentralized-supply-chain-pricing-postponement-or-payment-postponement.pdf", "question": "What is the definition of supply risk and how does it impact supply chain management?", "answer": "Supply risk refers to the potential for disruptions or uncertainties in the supply chain that can affect the availability, quality, or cost of goods and services. It is one of the most significant risks that firms face in their global supply chains, as highlighted by Gyorey et al. (2010), who reported that about two-thirds of executives identified supply uncertainty as one of the top three risks to manage.\n\nSupply risk can manifest in various forms, such as production yield risk, which is a major source of supply risk across industries. For instance, in agribusiness, crop yield per farmed acre inherently carries uncertainty due to factors like weather conditions, pests, and diseases. Similarly, in manufacturing, unexpected capacity deterioration or severe disruptions caused by events such as natural disasters or geopolitical tensions can lead to supply shortages.\n\nThe impact of supply risk on supply chain management is profound. It can lead to increased costs, reduced efficiency, and decreased customer satisfaction if not managed effectively. To mitigate these risks, firms often adopt specific strategies. For example, in a decentralized supply chain, retailers might implement mechanisms such as **payment postponement** (pay-by-delivery instead of pay-by-order) to delay procurement payments until after delivery. This approach incentivizes suppliers to improve their performance and reliability by aligning financial transactions with actual delivery outcomes.\n\nIn summary, supply risk encompasses uncertainties in supply availability and quality, which can significantly disrupt supply chain operations. Effective management of these risks through strategic measures, such as payment postponement, is crucial for maintaining supply chain resilience and ensuring business continuity."}

The focus here is on two primary postponement strategies: **pricing postponement** and **payment postponement**, and their implications for supply chain risk mitigation.\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n1. **Impact of Production Cost and Yield Loss**:\n   - When production costs are low and yield loss is highly likely, neither pricing nor payment postponement strictly benefits the retailer. This suggests that in scenarios where manufacturing processes are relatively inexpensive but prone to significant disruptions (e.g., high defect rates), neither strategy provides a clear advantage.\n   - Conversely, when production costs are relatively high, the retailer is more inclined to adopt payment postponement rather than pricing postponement. This indicates that in cost-intensive manufacturing environments, delaying payments may offer greater financial flexibility and risk mitigation compared to delaying pricing decisions.\n\n2. **Strategic Complements or Substitutes**:\n   - The relationship between pricing and payment postponement can be either complementary or substitutive, depending on the context. Specifically:\n     - If $ V > 0 $, the two strategies are complements, meaning that adopting one increases the value of using the other.\n     - If $ V < 0 $, the strategies are substitutes, implying that one reduces the value of the other.\n   - In certain situations, pricing and payment postponement act as strategic complements, suggesting that combining both strategies can enhance overall supply chain resilience and profitability.\n\n3. **Retailer's Preference Order**:\n   - With low production costs, retailers are more likely to prefer payment postponement over pricing postponement. This aligns with the idea that in less capital-intensive operations, deferring payments can improve cash flow without significantly impacting pricing dynamics.\n   - However, when production costs are high, retailers tend to favor pricing postponement. This preference reflects the need to adjust prices dynamically in response to market conditions or production uncertainties, which is particularly relevant in manufacturing contexts where costs are volatile.\n\n### Differences Between Manufacturing and Distribution:\n\n- **Manufacturing Context**:\n  - In manufacturing, the emphasis is often on managing production risks, such as yield losses and cost fluctuations. Here, payment postponement may be more effective due to its ability to provide financial relief during periods of high production costs.\n  - Pricing postponement becomes more valuable in scenarios where manufacturers face uncertain demand or input costs, allowing them to adjust prices after gaining better visibility into market conditions.\n\n- **Distribution Context**:\n  - In distribution, the focus shifts toward optimizing inventory and logistics risks. Payment postponement can help distributors manage cash flow pressures arising from holding inventory, especially in low-margin, high-turnover environments.\n  - Pricing postponement might be less critical for distributors unless they operate in markets with highly volatile demand or price-sensitive customers. In such cases, delaying pricing decisions allows distributors to align prices with real-time market signals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe choice between pricing and payment postponement depends on the specific risks and cost structures inherent to manufacturing versus distribution. Manufacturing tends to prioritize strategies that mitigate production-related risks, while distribution focuses on optimizing cash flow and inventory management. By understanding these nuances, businesses can tailor their postponement strategies to better align with their operational context and achieve superior supply chain performance."}

(2023) on supply risk mitigation in decentralized supply chains. Below is an evidence-based response derived from the knowledge repository:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights and Strategies**\n\n1. **Postponement as a Risk Mitigation Tool**  \n   - **Pricing Postponement**: Delaying the determination of prices until after more information about demand becomes available can help firms better align prices with actual market conditions. This reduces the adverse effects of demand uncertainty.\n   - **Payment Postponement**: Similarly, delaying payments to suppliers until after delivery (e.g., pay-by-delivery contracts) allows firms to adjust their financial commitments based on realized outcomes.\n\n2. **Strategic Complementarity Between Pricing and Payment Postponement**  \n   - The study reveals that pricing postponement and payment postponement are strategic complements. Implementing one strategy enhances the benefits of the other. For example:\n     - If a retailer delays pricing, it gains flexibility to set optimal prices closer to the point of sale, which increases profitability.\n     - Combining this with delayed payments further stabilizes cash flow and reduces financial risks associated with uncertain demand.\n\n3. **Conditions for Pareto Optimality**  \n   - Under certain conditions, these postponement strategies can achieve Pareto optimality for the entire supply chain. This means they can simultaneously increase firm profits and consumer surplus.\n   - Specifically, when supplier production levels ($Q^*$) are optimized under contracts like \"pay-by-delivery,\" the expected profit function $\\mathbf{E}[w\\hat{q} - cQ]$ ensures alignment between supplier incentives and downstream demand fluctuations.\n\n4. **Optimal Production Levels Under Uncertainty**  \n   - The delivered quantity $\\hat{q} = \\min\\{YQ, q\\}$ reflects the interplay between production capacity ($Q$) and random yield ($Y$). By maximizing the supplier's expected profit function, firms can determine the optimal production level $Q^*$ that balances cost and revenue under uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### **Actionable Recommendations**\n\n- **Adopt Flexible Pricing Mechanisms**: Use dynamic pricing models that allow adjustments based on real-time demand signals. This could involve machine learning algorithms or econometric forecasting techniques.\n- **Implement Pay-by-Delivery Contracts**: Structure supplier agreements to delay payments until after delivery. This reduces upstream risk exposure while maintaining operational flexibility.\n- **Integrate Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leverage historical sales data and predictive analytics to refine estimates of available-for-sale amounts ($X$) and market prices ($p$).\n- **Collaborate Across the Supply Chain**: Align incentives across all stakeholders to ensure that postponement strategies benefit both individual firms and the overall supply chain ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining pricing postponement with payment postponement, firms can effectively mitigate risks arising from uncertain demand. These strategies not only enhance profitability but also contribute to broader supply chain efficiency. Applying the theoretical framework outlined by Geng et al. (2023), firms can identify optimal production levels and pricing policies tailored to their specific contexts."}

The key characteristics of such a contract include:\n\n1. **Simplicity**: A price-only contract focuses solely on setting a unit wholesale price $ w $. This simplicity can make it easier to implement compared to more complex contracts that involve additional terms like quantity discounts or revenue-sharing.\n\n2. **Procurement Cost Determination**: Under this contract, the procurement cost for the retailer is determined by the wholesale price $ w $ multiplied by the order quantity $ q $. Specifically, if the payment is made upon ordering (pay-by-order), the procurement cost is given by $ T^{k} = w \\cdot q $ for scenarios $ k \\in \\{OA, OR\\} $.\n\n3. **Impact on Supply Chain Coordination**: According to Proposition 6 in the knowledge repository, postponing payment under a price-only contract does not inherently coordinate the supply chain. This means that simply delaying the payment timing does not resolve inefficiencies or risks within the supply chain unless accompanied by other mechanisms.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation Potential**: While price-only contracts are simple, they can still mitigate risk effectively if paired with an appropriate payment scheme. For example, adjusting the payment timing or conditions can help reduce the burden of uncertain yields in the upstream production process.\n\n### Differences from Other Types of Contracts\n\n- **Complexity**: Unlike more sophisticated contracts (e.g., revenue-sharing, buy-back, or quantity-flexibility contracts), a price-only contract lacks additional clauses that might align the interests of suppliers and retailers more closely. These additional clauses in other contracts can enhance coordination and risk-sharing but at the cost of increased complexity.\n\n- **Coordination Ability**: As noted, a price-only contract alone does not typically coordinate the supply chain effectively. In contrast, contracts like revenue-sharing or two-part tariffs are specifically designed to align incentives between supply chain partners, often leading to better overall performance.\n\n- **Flexibility**: Price-only contracts offer less flexibility in terms of adapting to changing market conditions or unforeseen risks. More advanced contracts may include provisions for adjusting quantities, prices, or payments based on actual demand or supply outcomes.\n\nIn summary, while a price-only contract is straightforward and can be sufficient under certain conditions, its coordinating power is limited compared to more intricate contract types. However, with strategic adjustments—such as modifying payment schemes—it can still serve as an effective tool for managing and mitigating supply chain risks."}

The choice of payment scheme can influence how effectively these risks are mitigated and how well the supply chain is coordinated.\n\n1. **Double-Marginalization Issue**: Traditional wholesale price contracts, while simple and commonly used, often lead to the double-marginalization problem. This issue arises because both the supplier and the retailer add their own margins, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the overall supply chain. As a result, such contracts fail to fully coordinate the supply chain, potentially straining supplier-buyer relationships.\n\n2. **Pay-by-Order vs. Pay-by-Delivery Schemes**:\n   - **Pay-by-Order Scheme**: This involves payments being made upfront or at the time of order placement. It primarily addresses demand-side uncertainties by allowing suppliers to plan production more effectively based on pre-committed orders.\n   - **Pay-by-Delivery Scheme**: In contrast, this scheme involves payments being made only after the product is delivered and its quality or quantity is verified. This approach is particularly effective in dealing with supply-side uncertainties, such as yield risks, as it aligns payments with actual output realization.\n\n3. **Practical Applications**: These payment schemes are widely observed across various industries. For instance, in agricultural and livestock markets, \"production contracts\" correspond to pay-by-order schemes, whereas \"marketing contracts\" align with pay-by-delivery schemes. Similarly, in high-tech and biotech industries, where supply yield risks are significant, buyers often prefer pay-by-delivery schemes to ensure that payments are contingent upon the actual delivery of products meeting specified standards.\n\n4. **Simultaneous Consideration of Pricing and Payment Postponement**: Firms frequently consider both pricing postponement (addressing demand-side risks) and payment postponement (addressing supply-side risks) together as complementary tools for mitigating yield risks. This dual approach allows for a more balanced management of uncertainties, enhancing the robustness of supplier-buyer relationships.\n\nIn summary, the choice of payment scheme significantly influences supplier-buyer dynamics by affecting how risks are shared and managed. Pay-by-delivery schemes, in particular, offer a mechanism to better align incentives and reduce the adverse effects of supply-side uncertainties, thereby fostering more coordinated and resilient supply chain relationships."}

Below is an evidence-based response leveraging the knowledge repository provided:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Context of Supply Chain Risks**\n- **Key Insight**: In decentralized supply chains, uncertain supply significantly impacts decision-making for both suppliers and retailers. The timing of procurement payments can influence risk mitigation strategies.\n- **Evidence**: Geng et al. (2023) highlight that \"when and how the procurement payment is settled do affect the decisions of the channel members\" due to uncertain supply.\n\n**Action**: Begin by assessing the specific risks in your supply chain, such as variability in supplier yield or demand uncertainty. This will inform whether payment postponement strategies (e.g., pay-by-delivery) are more suitable than traditional upfront payments (e.g., pay-by-order).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Payment Timing Structures**\n- **Key Insight**: Payment timing structures, such as pay-by-order and pay-by-delivery, serve as tools for mitigating supply risks.\n- **Evidence**: \n  - Pay-by-order requires payment at the time of order placement based on the ordered quantity $ q $.\n  - Pay-by-delivery postpones payment until after the supplier's yield is realized, requiring payment only for the delivered quantity.\n\n**Action**: Analyze the trade-offs between these structures:\n  - **Pay-by-order**: Reduces supplier risk but increases retailer exposure to supply uncertainty.\n  - **Pay-by-delivery**: Aligns payments with actual delivery, reducing retailer risk but potentially increasing supplier financing needs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Model Retailer Profit Maximization**\n- **Key Insight**: The retailer's decision on order quantity $ q $ and retail price $ p $ depends on maximizing expected profit, which balances revenue and procurement costs.\n- **Evidence**: The retailer's expected profit function includes:\n  - Revenue: $ r(p, q; Q) = p \\cdot \\min\\{d(p), Y \\bar{Q} q\\} $, where $ d(p) $ is demand as a function of price, and $ Y \\bar{Q} q $ represents the realized supply.\n  - Procurement cost: Transfer payment $ T^k $, which varies by scenario $ k $. For example:\n    - Under pay-by-order: $ T^k = w \\dot{q} $.\n    - Under pay-by-delivery: Payment is contingent on delivered quantity.\n\n**Action**: Use this framework to simulate different payment scenarios and evaluate their impact on retailer profits. Consider factors like supplier reliability, demand elasticity, and cost parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assess Contract Coordination and Channel Dynamics**\n- **Key Insight**: The effectiveness of a procurement payment system depends on its ability to align incentives across the supply chain.\n- **Evidence**: Geng et al. (2023) note that while price-only contracts have been extensively studied, their timing structure remains underexplored. Properly designed payment systems can enhance coordination and reduce inefficiencies.\n\n**Action**: Design contracts that balance the interests of all parties:\n  - Ensure suppliers receive adequate compensation for their risks.\n  - Provide retailers with flexibility to manage uncertain supply.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Test and Refine Using Empirical Data**\n- **Key Insight**: Statistical significance and practical relevance are critical for validating the effectiveness of a procurement payment system.\n- **Evidence**: Cross-disciplinary integration of finance, econometrics, and strategic management enables precise identification of optimal payment structures.\n\n**Action**: \n  - Collect historical data on supplier performance, demand patterns, and transaction costs.\n  - Use econometric models to test the impact of different payment structures on profitability and risk mitigation.\n  - Iterate based on findings to refine the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Implement and Monitor**\n- **Key Insight**: Continuous monitoring ensures the procurement payment system remains aligned with evolving supply chain dynamics.\n- **Action**: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track:\n  - Supplier lead times and reliability.\n  - Retailer inventory levels and sales performance.\n  - Financial health of both parties.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAn effective procurement payment system integrates risk mitigation, profit maximization, and channel coordination. By carefully evaluating payment timing structures, modeling retailer behavior, and testing with empirical data, organizations can design systems that enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency. \n\n**Final Answer**: The steps involved in designing an effective procurement payment system are:\n1. Understand the context of supply chain risks.\n2. Evaluate payment timing structures (pay-by-order vs. pay-by-delivery).\n3. Model retailer profit maximization using revenue and procurement cost functions.\n4. Assess contract coordination and channel dynamics.\n5. Test and refine using empirical data.\n6. Implement and monitor continuously. \n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{These steps ensure alignment with theoretical insights and practical relevance.}}\n$$"}
{"标题": "geng-et-al-2023-supply-risk-mitigation-in-a-decentralized-supply-chain-pricing-postponement-or-payment-postponement.pdf", "question": "How does responsive pricing adapt to market dynamics and consumer behavior?", "answer": "Responsive pricing is a dynamic strategy that allows retailers to adjust prices in response to changes in market conditions, consumer behavior, and supply chain uncertainties. Based on the knowledge repository provided, here’s how responsive pricing adapts to market dynamics and consumer behavior:\n\n1. **Mitigating Yield Uncertainty**: Responsive pricing helps address yield uncertainty by allowing retailers to adjust prices after component supply risks are resolved and final products are ready for selling. This flexibility enables retailers to alleviate the detrimental impact of yield shortages on the end market, as opposed to setting an ex-ante determined price which might not reflect real-time supply conditions.\n\n2. **Consumer Surplus and Profit Dynamics**: When the retailer uses responsive pricing and certain conditions are met (e.g., $\\alpha \\geq 9/16$), both the supplier's and retailer's profits, as well as consumer surplus, can increase within specific cost ranges ($0 < c < \\tilde{C}$). This indicates that responsive pricing can lead to a win-win situation where both businesses and consumers benefit under appropriate market conditions.\n\n3. **Demand Risk Absorption**: Even with responsive pricing, demand risk remains a factor. The optimal responsive price $p^{*} = p^{*}(q,w,Q \\mid Y)$, while contingent on $\\gamma$, still needs to account for demand variability. However, this approach ensures that prices are set based on more accurate information about both supply and demand, leading to better alignment with consumer behavior.\n\n4. **Analytical Challenges**: The convexity of the demand function $D(p)$ can complicate the concavity of the retailer’s revenue function, posing analytical challenges. Despite this, responsive pricing remains a valuable tool for adapting to market dynamics because it allows for real-time adjustments based on updated information about supply and demand.\n\nIn summary, responsive pricing adapts to market dynamics and consumer behavior by enabling real-time price adjustments that reflect current supply conditions and demand patterns. This flexibility can enhance profitability for suppliers and retailers while potentially increasing consumer surplus, although it requires careful management of demand risk and analytical complexities."}
{"标题": "geng-et-al-2023-supply-risk-mitigation-in-a-decentralized-supply-chain-pricing-postponement-or-payment-postponement.pdf", "question": "What is the concept of ex ante pricing and how does it work in contractual agreements?", "answer": "Ex ante pricing refers to a pricing strategy where the retailer commits to a retail price **before** the random yield or supply is realized. This means that the price is set in advance, even though there is uncertainty about the actual supply or production output at the time of pricing. In this scenario, because the retail price is decided prior to knowing the exact supply, the retailer assumes the responsibility for absorbing any supply risk. If the supply turns out to be less than anticipated, the retailer may face shortages and potential losses; conversely, if the supply exceeds demand, the retailer might have excess inventory.\n\nIn contractual agreements, ex ante pricing can serve as a mechanism to persuade suppliers to enter into specific types of contracts, such as **pay-by-delivery contracts**. A pay-by-delivery contract implies that the supplier is compensated based on the actual quantity delivered, rather than a fixed payment upfront. By committing to an ex ante price, the retailer provides the supplier with more certainty regarding revenue expectations, which can incentivize the supplier to agree to terms that align their interests more closely. This is particularly relevant in industries like agriculture and livestock, where supply risks are significant due to unpredictable factors like weather or disease outbreaks.\n\nFor example, in agricultural settings, producers might presell their processed products before production begins (ex ante pricing), ensuring they have committed buyers and stabilizing their income despite uncertain yields. However, this approach contrasts with **responsive pricing**, where the retailer postpones the pricing decision until after the yield is known, allowing for better matching of supply and demand but potentially at the cost of reduced supplier incentives.\n\nIn summary, ex ante pricing works by setting prices early in the supply chain process, shifting the supply risk onto the retailer. This can facilitate contractual agreements, especially when paired with mechanisms like pay-by-delivery contracts, which help mitigate risks for both parties involved."}
{"标题": "geng-et-al-2023-supply-risk-mitigation-in-a-decentralized-supply-chain-pricing-postponement-or-payment-postponement.pdf", "question": "How does the double-marginalization problem arise in decentralized supply chains and what are potential solutions?", "answer": "The double-marginalization problem arises in decentralized supply chains due to the independent profit-maximizing behavior of each entity within the chain, typically the supplier and the retailer. In a decentralized supply chain, both parties set their own prices independently, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the overall system. Specifically, when the supplier sets a wholesale price and the retailer sets a retail price, both aim to maximize their individual profits, which often results in higher prices for end consumers and lower total supply chain profits compared to a centralized system.\n\n### **How Double-Marginalization Arises**\n1. **Independent Decision-Making**: The supplier determines the wholesale price based on its production costs and desired margin, while the retailer adds its own markup to the wholesale price to cover operational costs and achieve its profit target. This leads to a cumulative effect where the final price paid by consumers is higher than it would be if the supply chain were centrally managed.\n   \n2. **Wholesale Price Contract Limitations**: As noted in the knowledge repository, the wholesale price contract, though widely used, fails to coordinate the supply chain effectively because it does not account for the interdependencies between the supplier and the retailer. This lack of coordination exacerbates the double-marginalization issue.\n\n3. **Impact of Production Costs**: When production costs are low ($c < \\tilde{C}$), using responsive pricing to match supply with demand can amplify the double-marginalization problem, potentially harming the retailer's profitability. However, as production costs increase ($c > \\tilde{C}$), the benefits of aligning supply with demand through responsive pricing outweigh the negative effects of double-marginalization.\n\n### **Potential Solutions**\nTo mitigate the double-marginalization problem, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. **Payment Postponement (Pay-by-Delivery Scheme)**:\n   - Altering the timing structure of payments can help alleviate the issue. For instance, implementing a pay-by-delivery scheme allows the retailer to delay payment until after the product is delivered and sold. This reduces the financial risk for the retailer and encourages better alignment between the supplier and the retailer.\n   - According to the knowledge repository, such a strategy can improve channel coordination and reduce the adverse effects of double-marginalization.\n\n2. **Responsive Pricing**:\n   - For production costs within a certain range ($c_1^{DR} < c < c_2^{DR}$), responsive pricing dominates other strategies. By dynamically adjusting prices to match supply with demand, the retailer can achieve higher profits despite the presence of double-marginalization.\n   - Proposition 2 in the repository highlights that responsive pricing is particularly effective when production costs are not excessively low, as it allows the retailer to capitalize on market dynamics.\n\n3. **Contract Design**:\n   - Beyond simple wholesale price contracts, more sophisticated contracts such as revenue-sharing, buy-back, or quantity-flexibility contracts can be implemented. These contracts encourage collaboration and shared risk between the supplier and the retailer, thereby reducing the impact of double-marginalization.\n   - For example, a revenue-sharing contract allows both parties to share the profits generated from sales, aligning their incentives and promoting supply chain efficiency.\n\n4. **Centralized Decision-Making**:\n   - While challenging to implement in practice, transitioning to a more centralized decision-making model can eliminate double-marginalization entirely. In this setup, a single entity manages both production and retail operations, optimizing the entire supply chain for maximum efficiency and profitability.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe double-marginalization problem in decentralized supply chains stems from the misalignment of incentives between suppliers and retailers. To address this issue, strategies such as payment postponement, responsive pricing, advanced contract design, and centralized decision-making can be employed. Each solution has its own advantages and applicability depending on factors like production costs, market conditions, and the specific nature of the supply chain. By carefully selecting and implementing these strategies, supply chain participants can enhance coordination, reduce inefficiencies, and ultimately improve overall profitability."}
